The task was to create a calculator with Cursor for the AI bootcamp.
The calculator was drawn by me, coding was aided with Cursor. Easter eggs include certain numbers which cause the calculator to spin upside down, e.g. "0.7734". Added a ? button to provide information about the calculator project.
